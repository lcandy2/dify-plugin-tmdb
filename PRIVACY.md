# Privacy Policy for TMDB Plugin

## Data Collection and Usage

The TMDB (The Movie Database) Plugin for Dify collects and processes the following information:

1. **API Read Access Token**: Your TMDB API Read Access Token is required to authenticate requests to The Movie Database API. This token is:
   - Stored securely within your Dify workspace
   - Never shared with third parties other than TMDB's official API service
   - Used only to perform the search functions requested by you

2. **Search Queries**: When you use the plugin to search for movies, TV shows, or people, your search queries are:
   - Transmitted to TMDB's servers to retrieve relevant results
   - Not stored permanently by the plugin
   - Processed according to TMDB's own privacy policy

3. **Search Results**: Data returned from TMDB, such as movie details, TV show information, and people profiles:
   - Is displayed to you through the Dify interface
   - May be cached temporarily to improve performance
   - Is not used for any purpose other than fulfilling your search requests

## Data Security

- All communication with TMDB's API is conducted over secure HTTPS connections
- Your API Read Access Token is stored securely using Dify's credential management system
- The plugin only requests read-only access to TMDB data; it cannot modify your TMDB account or data
